            <h2>Method Overview</h2> <!-- Translated heading -->
            <p>
                XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful and efficient implementation of the gradient
                boosting algorithm. While primarily known for classification and regression tasks on tabular data,
                it can be effectively applied to time series forecasting by transforming the time series
                problem into a supervised learning problem. This typically involves creating meaningful
                features from past observations, such as lagged values and rolling statistics, as well as
                time-based features (like month, year, day of week/year).
            </p>
            <p>
                The model is then trained on these features to predict the future value of the series. XGBoost's
                ability to handle complex relationships and feature interactions makes it a strong candidate for
                time series where patterns may not be purely linear or simple.

            <p>
                For this XGBoost demonstration, I used the dataset on monthly aggregated sales data.
                The original data covered the period from 2014 to 2017. Feature engineering was performed
                on this data to create relevant inputs for the XGBoost model.

            <p>
                The XGBoost model was trained after transforming the time series into a supervised learning dataset
                using generated features. Below are plots visualizing the data, the model's performance, and the importance of features.

                This graph illustrates the XGBoost model's forecast (green dashed line) against the actual values
                (orange line) in the test set. The training data (blue line) is also shown for context. This highlights
                how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

                The feature importance plot from XGBoost indicates which features were most influential in making predictions.
                Lagged values and rolling means are typically strong predictors in time series forecasting,
                along with relevant time-based features.

                [Brief conclusion on how well XGBoost performed on your specific data using feature engineering.
                 What features were most important? How does its performance compare to SARIMA and Prophet based on visual inspection and metrics?
                 For example: "XGBoost, powered by engineered features, demonstrated [mention performance, e.g., competitive accuracy] on this time series.
                 The feature importance plot highlighted [mention key features, e.g., the 12-month lag and rolling averages] as significant predictors.
                 Its performance was [compare to others, e.g., slightly worse than Prophet but better than SARIMA / highly accurate, leveraging non-linear relationships]."].
