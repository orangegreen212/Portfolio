            <p>
                SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) is a classical statistical model that
                extends the ARIMA model to explicitly account for seasonality in time series data. It is well-suited
                for data with clearly defined seasonal patterns. The model is specified by parameters (p, d, q)(P, D, Q, S),
                where (p, d, q) relate to the non-seasonal components and (P, D, Q, S) to the seasonal components.

            <h2>Data Used</h2> <!-- Translated heading -->
            <p>
                For this SARIMA demonstration, the time series data used is based on monthly data.
                The dataset covers the period from 2014 to 2017.

        <section class="code-implementation">
            <h2>Python Implementation</h2> <!-- Translated heading -->
            <p>
                Below are key code snippets used to train and forecast using the SARIMA model.
                Determining the optimal (p, d, q)(P, D, Q, S) parameters often involves analyzing ACF/PACF plots
                or using automated parameter selection algorithms (e.g., <code>auto_arima</code>).

            <h2>Forecasting Results</h2> <!-- Translated heading -->
            <p>
                After training the SARIMA model, the following results were obtained on the test set and for future periods:

            <!-- Image 1: Shows a forecast into the future -->

            <img src="../images/SARIMA_1.png" alt="SARIMA Future Forecast Plot">
             <p>
                This comprehensive plot shows the original training data (blue), the model's fit on the training data (green),
                the actual values in the test set (orange), and the model's forecast on the test set (red).
                It provides a complete picture of the model's performance across both the training and testing phases.

             <p>
                This zoomed-in view focuses on the test period, allowing a closer look at how well the SARIMA forecast (in orange)
                matches the actual values (in blue) during this unseen period. This helps assess the model's short-term predictive accuracy.

            <h2>Conclusion on SARIMA</h2> <!-- Translated heading -->
            <p>
                [Brief conclusion on how well SARIMA performed on your specific data.
                 What patterns did it capture? What were its limitations or challenges?
                 For example: "The SARIMA model successfully captured both the overall trend and the pronounced annual seasonality in the data.
                 However, it struggled somewhat with forecasting sharp peaks..."].
