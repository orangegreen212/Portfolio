            <p>
                Prophet is a forecasting library developed by Facebook specifically designed for time series data
                with strong seasonal effects, holidays, and missing data. It is particularly effective for
                business time series that often have daily, weekly, and yearly seasonality, plus irregular
                events. Prophet works by decomposing the time series into trend, seasonality, and holiday effects.

            <h2>Data Used</h2> <!-- Translated heading -->
            <p>
                For this demonstration of the Prophet method, I used the dataset on monthly online sales.
                The raw data covers the period from 2014 to 2017. For monthly analysis, the data was aggregated by month.
            </p>

            <h2>Forecasting Results & Analysis</h2> <!-- Translated heading -->
            <p>
                The Prophet model was trained on the historical data. Below are plots visualizing the original data,
                the model's fit, and the forecasts on the test set and for future periods.

            <p>
                This plot shows the raw daily sales data used in the project. It highlights the variability and potential seasonal patterns at the daily level.

                This graph displays the monthly aggregated data, the model's fit on the training data, and the forecast
                on the test set and a short period into the future. It provides an overview of how Prophet captures the overall trend and seasonality.

                Focusing on the test period, this plot allows for a closer examination of Prophet's predictive performance
                on unseen data. It shows how closely the forecast aligns with the actual values in the last few months.

                Prophet automatically provides a breakdown of the forecast into its constituent components:
                the long-term trend, weekly seasonality, and yearly seasonality. This helps understand the
                underlying patterns that influence the time series.

                [Brief conclusion on how well Prophet performed on your specific data.
                 What patterns did it capture? How did it handle seasonality or outliers?
                 How does it compare to other methods based on visual inspection and metrics?
                 For example: "Prophet demonstrated good performance in capturing the strong yearly seasonality and overall trend.
                 Its component plots provided valuable insights into the drivers of the time series. It handled [mention something specific, e.g., weekly patterns] effectively."].
