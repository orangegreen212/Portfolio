        # Portfolio: Comparative Study of Time Series Forecasting Techniques

## ðŸ“ˆ Illuminating Temporal Patterns: An Analytical Showcase

Time series data presents unique challenges and opportunities for data scientists. Capturing trends, complex seasonalities, and external influences within a sequence of observations is fundamental for reliable prediction. This portfolio presents a **comparative analysis demonstrating the application of three prominent time series forecasting methodologies**:

1.  **SARIMA:** A foundational statistical model based on autoregression, differencing, and moving averages, extended for seasonality.
2.  **Prophet:** A specialized additive model designed for business time series, robust to missing data and shifts in trends and seasonality.
3.  **XGBoost:** A tree-boosting algorithm adapted for forecasting via supervised learning transformation, excelling at capturing non-linear relationships and leveraging engineered features.

Each section serves as a detailed case study. I provide an overview of the theoretical underpinnings and practical considerations of the method. Key implementation steps are outlined, critical visualizations illustrate the model's fit and forecast performance on a real dataset, and quantitative metrics are presented for objective evaluation. This project aims to provide a clear view of the capabilities, assumptions, and results achievable with these diverse forecasting tools.
